# bootcamp-hero
A basic file structure useful for bootcamp students to stay organized.

## Why?

This repository is meant as a jumping off point for students, and is in NO WAY the ONLY organization structure that cna be used for a bootcamp. If you are starting or have started a bootcamp and are struggling to get all the files organized, this is a great option for you to use as a starting place.

## The structure
- [/challenges](/challenges)
  - Used to store weekly challenges / homeworks, clone the repository you create for that weeks' challenge into this directory. 
- [/class-repo](/class-repo)
  - This directory should be replaced with the clone of your class repository, treat this directory as read only. To get the latest, open the directory you cloned in your terminal and run `git pull` 
- [/code-playground](/code-playground)
  - This directory is for any non-class related code practice or testing. I recommend putting things into directories by the week you did them to help stay organized.
- [/live](/live)
  - This directory is used to store copies of each weeks' in-class activities, simply copy and paste them into this directory and use it as your working directory for activities.
- [/modules](/modules)
  - Used to store weekly modules as you work on them.
- [/projects](/projects)
  - Used to store group projects as you work on them.
